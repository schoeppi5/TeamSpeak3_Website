# TeamSpeak3_Website
A Website for a TeamSpeak3 Server and additional supported Gameservers

# Introduction
This is actually the third attempt on this project. By the time you read this I may have deleted the other two. Anyways: What is that?
That is a website build with HTML, CSS, JQuery and PHP. It's purpose is to display information about one TeamSpeak 3 Server and several gameserers.

## The TeamSpeak part
The website displays common information like how many slots does the server have and how many clients are online. Furthermore it displays a representation of the servers channelstruckture and lets you directly join one of the channels.
It also provides a link to join the server without a specific channel. Also you are able to log yourself in when you are logged in the server at the same time. As soon as you are logged in you are able to poke clients from the website even if you are offline.

## The gameserver part
The website can shows common information about gameservers that are ever a minecraft server or a server based on the source or goldsrc engine.
